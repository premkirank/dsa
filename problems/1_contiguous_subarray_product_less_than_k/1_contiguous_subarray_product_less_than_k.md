# Level

Medium

# Status

Was not able to come up with optimal solution

# Tags

Arrays

# Approaches

- Naive Approach
  - Forming all contiguous subarrays
  - Product of all values in subarray and filtering based on product < k
- DP Approach
  - DFS iteration
  - Product of current subarray is product of previous subarray * last value in current subarray
  - Stopping further search for an index if product > k
  - Storing computed product values in a Map for lookup e.g ```{"[2,3]": 6```
- Sliding Window Approach (best)
